Open Badge Factory plugin
=================

Open Badge Factory is a cloud platform that provides the tools your organization needs to implement a meaningful and sustainable Open Badges system.

With the local_obf plugin you can issue Open Badges created in Open Badge Factory. To use the plugin, you need an account on
[https://openbadgefactory.com](https://openbadgefactory.com) (You can register for free, see
[https://openbadgefactory.com/en/pricing/](https://openbadgefactory.com/en/pricing/) for details about different service levels).

**IMPORTANT WARNING**

A Pro-level subscription is required for plugin versions 2.0.0 and newer.
Organisations on Basic or Premium plans should not upgrade to this version.

This plugin no longer uses the OBF APIv1. OAuth2-based API keys are now required.
Obsolete legacy API keys (APIv1 client-side certificates) must be replaced with new keys.
To continue using the plugin, ensure your OBF account is on the Pro level and that you have access to OAuth2 keys.

How to install
--------------

1. Install the zip via Moodle's plugin page. Select "local" as the type of the plugin. (alternative: unzip to moodle's local subdirectory)

Post install
------------------

To connect to Open Badge Factory, the plugin needs an API key.

To generate the required OAuth2 API key, log in to Open Badge Factory. When logged in, navigate to `Admin tools > API`.

On the API key page click on `Generate new client secret` for OAuth2 Client Credentials. Give a description for the key and copy the client id and secret values into OBF Moodle plugin settings, in `Site administration > Open Badges > Settings`.
